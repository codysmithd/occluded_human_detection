# Occluded Human Detection
Matlab implementation of machine learning to detect occluded and non-occluded humans in images. Final project for CMPE685. Uses a machine learning approach with an SVM and Naive Bayes as classifiers and HOG, LBP, and Object Proposals for features.

For the Object Proposals, you will need to download piotr dollar's toolbox for matlab and his edge detection code
